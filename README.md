# Matrix Multiplication With Matrix Slicing

## What is matrix slicing?
- Matrix slicing is a way to extract a subset of a matrix, which is a two-dimensional array of numbers or other data types. 
Slicing allows you to select specific rows and columns from the matrix, or even a smaller rectangular portion of the matrix.

## When we need Matrix Slicing??
Matrix slicing can be useful in many scenarios where you need to extract a subset of a matrix for further processing or analysis. Here are some examples of when you might need to use matrix slicing:

- <b>Data analysis</b>: In data analysis, you might have a large matrix of data with many columns and rows. You might need to select specific columns or rows to perform calculations or analysis on. Matrix slicing allows you to quickly extract the relevant data for your analysis.

- <b>Image processing</b>: In image processing, images are often represented as matrices of pixel values. You might need to extract a portion of the image to perform some operation on it, such as blurring or cropping. Matrix slicing allows you to quickly extract the relevant portion of the image.

- <b>Machine learning</b>: In machine learning, you might have a matrix of input data with many features (columns) and samples (rows). You might need to select a subset of the features or samples to train your model on. Matrix slicing allows you to quickly extract the relevant data for your model.


Overall, matrix slicing is a powerful tool that can help you efficiently extract the data you need from a matrix, regardless of the specific application.
